## 🏗️ **Project Overview**

A retrospective cohort study to analyze pain outcomes between all-polyethylene tibia (APT) vs. metal-backed tibia (MBT) in primary total knee arthroplasty using propensity score matching and linear mixed effect model.


---

## 📊 **Data Exploration**

This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from patients who underwent primary TKA performed by a single surgeon at a single center between January 2021 and October 2024. Patient chart data were categorized based on tibial implant design(APT vs MBT). After applying exclusion criteria, propensity score matching incompletely but significantly reduced baseline differences between groups.

## 🧠 **Model Development**

* Models used: Linear Mixed-Effects Model

---

## 📈 **Results & Key Findings**

* The 95% confidence interval in NRS pain scores was (-0.51, 0.19), indicating no statistically significant difference in scores.
* Flexion range of motion was similar between groups, reaching approximately 120 degrees.
* The extension range of motion was also comparable, near zero degrees.

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

**You might consider addressing the following (as applicable):**

* What are some of the limitations of your model? : While descriptive analysis showed some differences in other outcomes like revision and manipulation under anesthesia, further research with larger, randomized controlled trials is needed to confirm these findings and assess long-term functional outcomes and patient satisfaction.
